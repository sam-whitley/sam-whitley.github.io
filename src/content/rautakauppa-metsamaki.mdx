## Project Description

The goal of this project was to develop an order management system that allows users to place new orders, 
as well as modify and track their progress. The system was designed for a fictional company. Both the design and development were 
carried out through GitHub and in-person meetings at Häme University of Applied Sciences. The programming languages used were C#, 
part of the C programming language family, and SQL, the standard query language for relational databases.
